# AddressBook

Addressbook is a web application that is written using React JS. The application includes a visible contact list and also includes the functionality to create, edit and delete contacts.

The address book captures the following information for each contact: Name, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, Town/City, County, Postcode, Telephone and Email. The address book also utilises the open source postcode lookup service https://postcodes.io/ for validating the postcode.


## Technical Architecture

The application uses webpack for bundling all the code into one js file
